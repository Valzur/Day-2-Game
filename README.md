# Day 2 game

Just like the name Implies, this game was a part of my 5 day challenge of A game a day,
this one ended up taking 2 days but essentilly the game features a simple maze 
generation algorithm for a variable grid size, the game itself is a topdown shooter with 
an automatically generated route.


## Installation

Simply download the game from the releases section and run "Day 2 Game.exe", 
or clone the entire repo if you'd like the source code :"D
